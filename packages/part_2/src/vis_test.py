vis.py

Offline visualization of a robot path integrated from the wheels command topic
in a ROS bag file. This version is aware that when reversing a compensation is
added to the right wheel. It also allows scaling of the commanded speeds via a
parameter so that the integrated distance matches the actual distance traveled.

Usage:
    ./vis.py <bag_file.bag> [vehicle_name] [reverse_compensation] [tolerance] [speed_scale]

    - bag_file.bag:         Path to the ROS bag file.
    - vehicle_name:         (Optional) Vehicle name (default "duckiebot").
    - reverse_compensation: (Optional) The compensation added during reverse (default 0.02).
    - tolerance:            (Optional) Tolerance for detecting compensation (default 0.005).
    - speed_scale:          (Optional) A scaling factor for the wheel commands (default 1.0).

The script assumes that the wheels command topic is:
    /<vehicle_name>/wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd
and uses differential-drive kinematics:
    v     = (v_left + v_right) / 2
    omega = (v_right - v_left) / wheel_base

When in reverse (i.e. both wheel speeds negative), if the measured bias
(v_right - v_left) is within tolerance of the known reverse_compensation value,
the bias is removed (by replacing v_right with v_left) before further processing.
Finally, the wheel commands are multiplied by the speed_scale factor.

    """
    Processes the bag file and integrates the robot pose using wheels_cmd messages.

    For reverse motion, if the measured bias is within tolerance of the known
    reverse_compensation value, the bias is removed. Then, a scaling factor is
    applied to the (possibly corrected) wheel commands.

    Args:
        bag_file (str): Path to the ROS bag file.
        wheels_topic (str): The topic to use for wheel commands.
        wheel_base (float): Distance between wheels in meters.
        reverse_compensation (float): The reverse compensation value to remove.
        tolerance (float): Tolerance for deciding whether to remove the bias.
        speed_scale (float): Scale factor applied to the wheel commands.

    Returns:
